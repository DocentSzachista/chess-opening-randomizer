# Chess opening randomizer

## Introduction
As the title of project says it is an app to randomize chess openings. Why? I had request from my friend if I can write that kind of app. 
Why flutter? I wanted to try write mobile app and here you can see outcome.

## So what can I do here?
You can randomize openings, add new openings to database and delete ones that you don't like. 
In nearest future I will try to add preview screenshots.

## Plans for future
- Add insertion through upload PGN file,
- Display openings on a chess board,
- Very far future: add some sort of learning platform
